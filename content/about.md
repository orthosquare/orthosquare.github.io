I am currently a PhD candidate in the School of Mathematics at Monash University, supervised by [Ian Wanless](http://users.monash.edu.au/~iwanless/). My areas of interest include Latin Squares, Computational Graph Theory, Theory of Computation, and Algorithm Design. My current areas of study include Perfect 1-factorisations and MOLS of order 10.

While completing a bachelors degree in Computer Science I grew increasingly interested in the mathematical and combinatorial nature of computation.
